About This Project

I have worked with many sliders in different projects, but most of them always felt the same — flat, simple left-right movement, and nothing visually unique. So I wanted to create something more dynamic and modern.

This project is my attempt to build a 3D rotating image slider that feels alive, interactive, and visually fresh.
Instead of a traditional horizontal slider, this version uses:

3D CSS transforms

Circular rotation

Depth (translateZ)

Perspective view

Hover-based pause + zoom

It gives the user a more immersive experience and stands out from standard UI patterns.

💡 Why I Built This Slider in Next.js

Even though this design works in plain HTML/CSS, I chose Next.js because it provides real development advantages:

✔ Component Reusability

The slider becomes a reusable UI module instead of repeated HTML code.

✔ Image Optimization

Next.js automatically optimizes images, improving loading speed and performance.

✔ Faster Rendering (SSR/ISR)

Pages load quicker because they can be rendered on the server.

✔ Scalable Project Structure

Perfect foundation for adding future features like:

dynamic image loading

API-based sliders

admin panel to upload images

animations controlled by state

✔ Professional Codebase

Next.js turns a simple idea into a production-ready, portfolio-level project.
